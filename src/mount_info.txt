The container uses the following mount locations:

/data/db        where .ardrive-cli.db is created at (holds wallet and state)
/data/sync      to act as a sync directory for uploads and downloads.
/data/wallets   to allow the CLI to access and save wallet files

It is sufficient to mount an empty directory to /data - these scripts will
create the missing directories upon container start.

********************************************************************************
*     It is recommended to create an Arweave-wallet with an external tool      *
*        and copy it to data/wallets prior to starting the container.          *
********************************************************************************

The CLI can be used to create a wallet, but care must be taken to save it to
mounted persistent storage - saving it inside the container may lead to
LOSING THE WALLET FILE once the container stops, resulting in loss of control
of the newly-created Arweave-address along with ALL FUNDS IN IT!

After ardrive-cli has been initialized, the wallet file should be moved away as
it is then saved to the internal database (located in /data/db) in encrypted
form. Wallet .json -files are NOT encrypted so they should be kept safe.

/data/db and /data/sync should always be mounted on permanent storage
in order to upload files and have the state of the container persist.


TO GET STARTED:

    # Prepare
    mkdir $(pwd)/data
    
    # If you have a wallet
    mkdir $(pwd)/data/wallets
    cp <wallet.json> $(pwd)/data/wallets

    # Run the container
    docker run -it -v $(pwd)/data:/data <image>
