    --- THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL IMAGE ---

# QUICK START #    
###############

    mkdir $(pwd)/data

    # If you have an Arweave-wallet JSON file:
    mkdir $(pwd)/data/wallets
    cp <wallet.json> $(pwd)/data/wallets

    docker run -it -v $(pwd)/data:/data <imagename>




###############
# DESCRIPTION #
###############

    "ardrive-cli" is a tool that can be used to interact with ArFS, a filesystem built on top of the Arweave permaweb
    that allows the creation of public and private virtual drives capable of storing files permanently.

    A wallet file is required to interact with the blockweave - one can either be supplied manually or
    generated via ardrive-cli. Uploading files requires and consumes Arweave's native cryptocurrency, AR.

    **********************************************************************************************************
    *** WARNING - GENERATING THE WALLET IN THE CONTAINER MAY LEAD TO PERMANENT LOSS OF ACCESS TO YOUR DATA ***
    **********************************************************************************************************
    Only do this if you're absolutely sure you know what you're doing.
    
    The preferred method of creating a wallet is either via tools found from https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave
    or with a browser extensions such as https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arweave/iplppiggblloelhoglpmkmbinggcaaoc

    The login and password combined with the Arweave-wallet are used to derive an encryption key for private drives.
    No actual user accounts exist within ArDrive at the writing of this.

# IMAGE INFORMATION #
#####################

    This docker image is based on the official node.js images (node:latest and node:slim) which are
    Debian-based at the moment of writing this.

    A builder image was used to build arweave-cli, which was then transferred to the slimmer base image
    as an effort to make the image smaller. 
  
    It currently pulls the latest master commit of https://github.com/ardriveapp/ardrive-cli, which means
    that the Dockerfile will almost certainly stop working after the v2 client is released. 

    This image exists mostly for historic preservation, at the advent of a new and improved v2-client.
    Though I will likely create a new image of the new version as well.

# USAGE #
#########

    docker run -it [--rm] -v [DATADIR]:/data <image> [FUNCTION]
    docker run -it [--rm] -v [DBDIR]:/data/db -v [SYNCDIR]:/data/sync -v [WALLETDIR]:/data/wallets <image>
    docker run -it [--rm] -v <image> [help/info]
    docker run -it [--rm] -v [DATADIR]:/data <image> [cli/nocheck/shell/resetdb]


    FUNCTIONS:

        cli       Run the ArDrive CLI. This is the default function.
        nochecks  Run the ArDrive CLI without safety checks. For advanced users only.
        resetdb   Delete the .ardrive-cli.db database file to start fresh.
        shell     Enter container shell
        help      Display this help.
        info      Display more detailed information.


    The container uses the following mount locations:

        /data/db        where .ardrive-cli.db is created at (holds wallet and state)
        /data/sync      to act as a sync directory for uploads and downloads.
        /data/wallets   to allow the CLI to access and save wallet files

     It is sufficient to mount an empty directory to /data - these scripts will
     create the missing directories upon container start.


********************************************************************************
*     It is recommended to create an Arweave-wallet with an external tool      *
*        and copy it to data/wallets prior to starting the container.          *
********************************************************************************

    The CLI can be used to create a wallet, but care must be taken to save it to
    mounted persistent storage - saving it inside the container may lead to
    LOSING THE WALLET FILE once the container stops, resulting in loss of control
    of the newly-created Arweave-address along with ALL FUNDS IN IT!

    After ardrive-cli has been initialized, the wallet file should be moved away as
    it is then saved to the internal database (located in /data/db) in encrypted
    form. Wallet .json -files are NOT encrypted so they should be kept safe.

    /data/db and /data/sync should always be mounted on permanent storage
    in order to upload files and have the state of the container persist.


    TO GET STARTED:

        # Prepare
        mkdir $(pwd)/data

        # If you have a wallet
        mkdir $(pwd)/data/wallets
        cp <wallet.json> $(pwd)/data/wallets

        # Run the container
        docker run -it -v $(pwd)/data:/data <image>


    To upload files, create a virtual drive with the CLI, then add the files into the corresponding
    drive directory located in the local sync dir, ie. "./data/sync/TestDrive2/".
    This can be done while ardrive-cli is running.


    *** THIS DOCKER IMAGE IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS ***
    Feedback appreciated.
